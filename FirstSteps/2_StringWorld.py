# You learned how to print things in the last lesson. What you learned was the basics of using both a function, the print statement, and a data-type- the string.
# A function is run by using its name and (). So print is the function and everything inside are called parameters, or 'arguments.' We'll learn more about these later.


# A string is inside a pair of single, or double quotes. 

new_var = "Tyler is cool"


# Fix what's wrong with this and add a comment explaining why this script will fail if you try to run it. 


even_newer_var = "Tyler ain't cool'

# When values are stored in variables, you can substitute their names for the data they contain. Print both of the above variables to the console below. 



# Strings can also be added together with the '+' opperator. 

combiner_string = "Tyler is" + " " + "cool"

# You can also insert a variable value within a string, this is called an f-string
age = 16
name = "OKAT"

string = f"There are some birds of prey such as {name} that are older than {age} years."


# What happens if you use + to combine a variable and a new string? What about two variables? Write 3 examples below. Write a fourth utilizing a f-string
