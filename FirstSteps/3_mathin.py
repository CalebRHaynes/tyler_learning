# One of pythons great capabilities is doing math.

# We'll introduce another data type here called the integer, which is just a whole number

# I can store an int like this
num_of_subpgm_members = 5

# and modify it like this in a new variable
uh_oh = num_of_subpgm_members - 1

# Here are some more math functions
days_in_4_weeks = 7 * 4

# Explain what happens if you do this on a string

tylers = "tyler" * 3



# what's the difference with these? Google will tell you, add a comment explaining each. 

expo_days = 7**4

i_am_indivisible = num_of_subpgm_members / 5 

this_ones_weird = expo_days % uh_oh

# add another example of an arithmentic operator below and use it to print a result to the console.
