# Now let's start learning Bools and comparisons

# In programming you often need to know if an expression is True or False.

# You can evaluate any expression in python, and get one of two answers, True or False


print(10 > 9)
print(10 == 9)
print(10 < 9)

# try printing these to the console. add your own example below. 

# write an example that will find out if a variable is "equal to or greater than" the other



# Booleans are logical statements such as And, Or, and Not. Write below what each of these mean by googling stuff like "and in python"



# write a statement using a "Or" boolean that will print True 


# write a statement using a "And" boolean that prints False


# Write a statement using a "Not" boolean that prints True



# BONUS QUESTION: How does a string evaluate? What about an empty string? Can you compare an integer and a string? Write 1-2 examples below.
