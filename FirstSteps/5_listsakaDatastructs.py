# For the last of the intro lessons, we'll be learning about the list, which is a "data structure"

# it is initialized like this

list_of_subpgm_members = ["Tyler", "Caleb", "Charles"]

# try adding more names to the list above and print out. 


# You can also print slices of a list at specific indicies. Try this out by printing the below variables

# notice that python starts counting at 0 instead of 1, it is therefore "0-indexed"

members_who_matter = list_of_subpgm_members[0:1]


whos_this_person = list_of_subpgm_members[1]


'''
There are several functions that come "built-in" when it comes to lists

in total there are 
append()	Adds an element at the end of the list
clear()	Removes all the elements from the list
copy()	Returns a copy of the list
count()	Returns the number of elements with the specified value
extend()	Add the elements of a list (or any iterable), to the end of the current list
index()	Returns the index of the first element with the specified value
insert()	Adds an element at the specified position
pop()	Removes the element at the specified position
remove()	Removes the first item with the specified value
reverse()	Reverses the order of the list
sort()	Sorts the list
'''
# we can operate on out lists by doing this- 

list_of_subpgm_members.append("Taylor Baumel???")

# What happens when you print the list out now?


# Taylor doesn't want to be involved. Use "pop" to remove her



# sort the list 




# now reverse it


# now make a new list of integers and add them using their indicies in the list
